{"name":"venus","tagline":"JS library for drawing statistics charts","body":"The original project has been abandoned for more than 2 years. But because of [hsrecorder](https://github.com/chinesedfan/hsrecorder), I discover it and want to reorganize it. My works here have little significance, except that let me remind something about PHP and obtain a first real try of Node.js. If someday the author or someone else wants to develop this project again, hope my documents can help.\r\n\r\n#Branches\r\n* master: the reorganized result\r\n* author: the original master branch\r\n* dw-venus: the customized branch by our Data Warehouse colleagues\r\n* issueX: refer to [issues](https://github.com/chinesedfan/venus/issues)\r\n\r\n#Folders\r\n* app: real applications based on this project\r\n* build: combo tools, config files and generated results\r\n\t* tool: the makefile is 'combo.js'\r\n* example: simple examples\r\n* lib: depended libraries\r\n* site: a website used to introduce this project\r\n* src: source files\r\n\t* canvas: the first version 'svg' and unused now (I guess)\r\n\t* common: common files\r\n\t* heatmap: for drawing heat maps\r\n\t* svg: for drawing basic charts\r\n\t* topology: for drawing topology charts\r\n* test: unit test files\r\n\r\n#Changes\r\nMainly I delete files that I think non-sense, like .DS_Store files, history generated files, empty files and duplicated files. For example:\r\n\r\n* 'src/canvas/dpchart.js' is nearly the same with 'src/canvas/canvaschart.js', except some exposed interfaces for testing. \r\n* 'src/svg/svgchart_rebuild.js', 'svg/topology/topology_rebuild.js' behave the same like 'src/svg/svgchart.js', 'svg/topology/topology.js'. The author just created them in a certain commitment and stopped to update the original one.\r\n\r\nSome new functionaries are also introduced, as described in [issue #3](https://github.com/chinesedfan/venus/issues/3). \r\n\r\nAt last, folders 'app/example/test' are updated, but no all tests can be passed, as deprecated methods are tested.\r\n\r\n#Notice\r\n* I didn't rebuild the file 'build/canvaschart.js' and 'build/topology.js' after their source files have been updated.\r\n* The folder 'site' still has some used or duplicated files.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
